Download from: https://github.com/CodersCafeTech/PomodoroBot/tree/main/Code/animations

**IMPORTANT**: 
- speaking.mp4 MUST exist for voice assistant to work properly
- blink.mp4 MUST exist as the default/fallback animation
- You can use any animated MP4 file for testing
- Videos should be H.264 encoded, 1080p or lower
- Keep videos short (2-10 seconds) as they will loop

**Quick Test Setup**:
If you don't have the original videos, you can:
1. Copy the same video 5 times and rename them
2. Or use ffmpeg to create simple colored videos:

ffmpeg -f lavfi -i color=c=blue:s=1280x720:d=3 blink.mp4
ffmpeg -f lavfi -i color=c=yellow:s=1280x720:d=3 yellow.mp4
ffmpeg -f lavfi -i color=c=red:s=1280x720:d=3 red.mp4
ffmpeg -f lavfi -i color=c=black:s=1280x720:d=3 black.mp4
ffmpeg -f lavfi -i color=c=green:s=1280x720:d=3 speaking.mp4
